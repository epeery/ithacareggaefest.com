Ithaca Reggae Fest is dedicated to the protection of Cayuga Lake through a vibrant celebration of Ithaca’s legendary reggae community and its history. With support from over 3,500 festival attendees and all of our sponsors in 2017, the Friends of Cayuga Lake made a $7,500 donation to support the purchase of a new boat for the Cayuga Lake Floating Classroom, which is now Discover Cayuga Lake. They’re fostering future stewards of Cayuga Lake by providing hands-on learning opportunities in the interest of sustaining our Finger Lakes waterways for future generations. #Reggae4Cayuga
