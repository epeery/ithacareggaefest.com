## Transportation & Parking

* Parking Lots (follow the festival parking signs)

  * Lot #2 Ithaca High School (1401 N Cayuga St, Ithaca, NY 14850) Distance = 0.7 miles

  * TCAT Route (13X & 13) will pick you up behind the IHS football field by the “Festival Bus Stop” sign. The same route (13X & 13) stops downtown at the Green St. Garage (126 E. Green Street) and Seneca St. Garage (215 N. Tioga Street), and multiple other stops throughout the downtown area. FREE TCAT FARE for anyone attending Ithaca Reggae Fest!

  * LimeBike will also have an abundance of LimeBike’s available in both parking lots for you to ride to Stewart Park. You can park them in the LimeBike sponsored Bike Valet, where all bikes are welcome. After the festivities are over you can ride a LimeBike back to your car, back to your house, or ride one to the after party at The Haunt (best option).
