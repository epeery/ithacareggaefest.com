## Youth Village

Youth Village is created and sponsored by Child Development Council. Please bring your junior reggae fans to the festival and enjoy some of our many engaging activities for youth. We’ll have festival crafts, face painting, lawn games, bubble play, and more. Yoga and percussion games will happen throughout the day. And if you need a place to unwind with your littles, we’ll have a dedicated area with a cozy book nook, simple toys, and a nursing area for Mamas. All youth under 16 are FREE at the festival!
