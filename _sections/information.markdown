# Information

## Education Village

Education Village is an aggregation of many of the dedicated water protectors, scientists, and community activists working to protect and restore the health of Cayuga Lake. We will offer interactive activities while sharing essential information inviting you to join our mission for a healthy, cleaner Cayuga Lake. Water is life and we are all stewards of our water both here in Ithaca, NY and around the world. Collectively we can make a difference.
