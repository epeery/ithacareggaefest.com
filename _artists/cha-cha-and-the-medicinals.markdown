Cha Cha and The Medicinals will combine forces for this year's Ithaca Reggae Fest. The Medicinals are very excited and humbled to be playing a full set of Cha Chaâ€™s original roots music and we are equally honored to be a part of this wonderful collaboration and event. Love, friendship and community guide this act's debut. The Medicinals are an 11-piece roots band from upstate NY that features members from Giant Panda Guerrilla Dub Squad, RootsCollider, Mosaic Foundation, Personal Blend, The Level 7 Experience, Hybrid Beats, Subsoil, Eli Flynn & the Everymen & Sol Vibration.
