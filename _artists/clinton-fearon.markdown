Born in Jamaica, Clinton became the bassist, vocalist and lyricist of the mythic Gladiators at the age of 19.

After leaving Jamaica in 1987, Clinton Fearon started a new career in Seattle.

> “ My music is roots reggae from the island of Jamaica. I grew up deep in the hills, up in St. Catherine, surrounded by nature, beauty and hard work. Even as a child, I knew I wanted to be a musician and began my career singing in church and at school, and eventually built my own guitar! As a teenager, my journeys took me to Kingston where I met many musicians and began writing and recording music. The Skatalites, Motown artists and Jamaican musicians who came before me all influenced my music. I write from my heart. The world is full of inspirations... nature, people, politics, love. I write about them all. My music is good for the soul - always with a message of hope and betterment for tomorrow. It’s good for dancing, good for listening and I think it’s good for all.” - Clinton Fearon
